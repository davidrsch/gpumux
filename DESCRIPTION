Description: Provides VRAM-aware worker management to safely run multiple
    'mirai' daemons on one or more GPUs. It supports both
    high-performance persistent workers and stable proxy workers that
    isolate tasks in separate processes. The package can also
    proactively initialize workers for specific deep learning frameworks,
    configuring GPU memory limits automatically.
